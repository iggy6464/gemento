|------|---------|
| Project name | Gemento (제멘토) |
| Core question | If a small LLM (4.5B) is given an external state (tattoo) and an iterative reasoning structure, can it achieve statistically significant quality improvement over single-pass inference? |
| Target model | Gemma 4 E4B (Exp00–06: Q4_K_M / Ollama, Exp07+: Q8_0 / llama.cpp GPU server) |
| Execution environment | Windows (Ollama or llama.cpp) — experiment execution / macOS — analysis and documentation |
| Research period | 2026-04-08 ~ ongoing |
| Sampling | `temperature=0.1`, `max_tokens=4096`, `top_p`/`seed` unset (single source: `config.py:SAMPLING_PARAMS` — introduced 2026-04-26 via sampling-params-config-exp10 plan) |

> *Note: H1–H9 below denote nine sequentially numbered hypotheses about externalization axes — they are **not** the statistical H₀ (null) / H₁ (alternative) pair.*

### Key Hypotheses

| ID | Hypothesis (externalization axis) | Final verdict | Decision experiment |
|----|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| H1 | **[Orchestrator externalization]** Multi-step loops produce higher quality than single-pass inference | **Supported** | Exp02 |
| H2 | **[Role externalization necessity — falsification]** Errors are amplified through loops | **Rejected** (no error detection) | Exp03 |
| H3 | **[Role externalization]** Cross-validation (role separation) can detect errors | **Supported** (80%) | Exp035 |
| H4 | **[Role externalization synergy]** A-B-C role separation outperforms repeated single-agent inference | ⚠ **Inconclusive** (Exp06 45 vs 45 reconciled: v1 +0.015 / v2 +0.067, both slightly favor Solo. Original "+22.6pp" not reproducible. Structural difference confirmed but accuracy Δ not observed — expanded task set needed) | Exp06 |
| H5 | **[Orchestrator externalization ceiling]** Increasing MAX_CYCLES contributes to accuracy improvement (saturation point exists) | **Partially rejected** (ceiling expansion ineffective, saturation at actual_cycles≈7) | Exp07 |
| H6 | **[Role externalization refinement]** Phase-specific prompts outperform baseline | **Partially supported** (long loops 15~20: +5~6pp) | Exp07 |
| H7 | **[Tool externalization]** External math tools (calculator/linalg/linprog) compensate for E4B's computational limits | **Supported** (+18.3pp, math-04 0→80%) | Exp08 |
| H8 | **[Tool externalization stability]** Error hints + Mandatory tool rules mitigate tool_neglect and operator confusion | **Supported** (neglect 0%, calculator 100%, math-04 0→100%, total +23.3pp) | Exp08b |
| H9a | **[Tattoo externalization — physical limit breakthrough]** ABC+Tattoo(chunked) outperforms Solo-dump in long-context settings | **Supported** (+68.3pp, Large 20K: Solo 0% → ABC 100%) | Exp09 |
| H9b | **[Differentiation]** ABC+Tattoo has unique contribution over RAG baseline | **⚠️ Inconclusive** (5-trial stats NOT SIGNIFICANT p=0.798; overall Δ=+2.0pp; 3-hop only +20.0pp differentiation; Small Paradox confirmed) | Exp09 |
| H9c | **[Error mode differences]** ABC's failure patterns are qualitatively different from Solo and RAG | **Supported** (Solo: format_error 24, RAG: wrong_synthesis 6, ABC: evidence_miss 2 + wrong_synthesis 3) | Exp09 |

### Exp00: Baseline (Single-pass Inference)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 1 (single model, no tattoo) |
| **When** | 2026-04-08 |
| **Where** | Windows Ollama local environment |
| **What** | Measuring single-pass inference quality of E4B without tattoo structure |
| **Why** | Establishing the comparison baseline for all subsequent experiments. Understanding "without" performance is necessary to measure the effect of the tattoo system |
| **How** | 6 tasks (math×2, logic×2, synthesis×2) × 3 repetitions = 18 data points. Question + necessary information only, single response |

**Results:**

| Task | Accuracy | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| math-01 | 3/3 (100%) | Basic arithmetic |
| math-02 | 3/3 (100%) | Multi-variable simultaneous equations |
| logic-01 | 0/3 (0%) | Response truncated due to output token limit |
| logic-02 | 0/3 (0%) | Inclusion-exclusion principle failure |
| synthesis-01 | 3/3 (100%) | Simple conditional synthesis |
| synthesis-02 | 0/3 (0%) | Multi-step path calculation failure |
| **Total** | **9/18 (50%)** | |

**Key Findings:**
1. Structured math → sufficient. Complex logic/synthesis → failure (0%)
2. Automated scoring (substring) overestimates — manual verification required
3. Scoring: v1=0.705, v2=0.722

**Conclusion:** E4B achieves 50% accuracy in single-pass inference. Structural support required for complex problems.

### Exp01: Assertion Cap (Tattoo Capacity Limit)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 1 |
| **When** | 2026-04-08 |
| **Where** | Windows Ollama |
| **What** | Measuring structured output stability across assertion counts (2~12) |
| **Why** | Validating whether the soft cap 8 / hard cap 10 decided in RT discussion is actually effective. Verifying if excessive assertions cause "middle forgetting" phenomenon |
| **How** | Assertion count = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12} × task × 3 repetitions. Pre-written correct assertions provided, JSON parsing success rate measured |

**Results:**

| Cap | JSON success rate |
|-----|-----------------|
| 2~12 | All 100% |

**Key Findings:**
1. Stable up to 12 assertions — no "middle forgetting" effect
2. Response time increases linearly with assertion count
3. RT recommendation (soft 8 / hard 10) maintained as valid

**Conclusion:** Assertion capacity is not a bottleneck within the experimental range.

### Exp02: Multi-step Loop Quality Accumulation (H1 Validation)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 1 (repeated calls) |
| **When** | 2026-04-09 |
| **Where** | Windows Ollama |
| **What** | Measuring accuracy and convergence rate changes across loop counts (1, 2, 4, 8) |
| **Why** | **H1 validation** — "Does repeatedly calling the same small LLM improve reasoning quality?" |
| **How** | Phase sequence (DECOMPOSE→INVESTIGATE→SYNTHESIZE→VERIFY→CONVERGED) managed by orchestrator. v1 (model-autonomous) → failure → v2 (orchestrator-forced) transition |

**Version Comparison:**

| Version | Convergence rate | Key difference |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| v1 (model-autonomous phase transition) | 0/72 (0%) | Model cannot make phase transitions/confidence judgments |
| **v2 (orchestrator-forced)** | **17/18 (94.4%)** | Orchestrator manages phase sequence |

**v2 Results:**

| Loops | Accuracy | Convergence | vs Baseline |
|-------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | 0% | 0% | −50pp (structural: answer impossible in DECOMPOSE) |
| 2 | 44.4% | 0% | −5.6pp |
| 4 | 66.7% | 44.4% | +16.7pp |
| **8** | **94.4%** | **94.4%** | **+44.4pp** |

**Key Findings:**
1. **H1 supported** — Baseline 50% → 8-loop 94.4%, monotonically increasing
2. **Decisive lesson:** Not a model problem but an orchestrator design problem. v1 (0%) → v2 (94.4%)
3. Role separation principle established: orchestrator = structure, model = execution

**Conclusion:** Multi-step loops are effective, but handing phase transitions to the model leads to failure. External structure management is essential.

### Exp03: Error Propagation and Self-Correction (H2 Validation)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 1 |
| **When** | 2026-04-09 |
| **Where** | Windows Ollama |
| **What** | Measuring the model's self-detection rate after injecting flaws (corrupt_content, inflate_confidence, contradiction) into the tattoo |
| **Why** | **H2 validation** — "Are flawed assertions amplified through loops, or self-corrected?" |
| **How** | 3 types of flaws injected at loops 2 and 4. 4 tasks × 3~9 trials = 15 data points. Confidence trajectory tracked |

**Results:**

| Flaw type | Trials | Detection rate | Confidence |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| corrupt_content | 9 | 0% | 1.0 (all) |
| inflate_confidence | 3 | 0% | 1.0 (all) |
| contradiction | 3 | 0% | 1.0 (all) |
| **Total** | **15** | **0%** | **1.0** |

**Key Findings:**
1. **H2 rejected (unexpected direction)** — Errors neither amplify nor get detected
2. E4B unconditionally trusts all assertions — naive executor
3. VERIFY phase does not function in practice
4. Self-reported confidence is unreliable (always 1.0)

**Conclusion:** Self-verification impossible. Error detection must be delegated to external (cross-validation) mechanisms.

### Exp035: Cross-Validation Gate

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 1 (critic-dedicated prompt) |
| **When** | 2026-04-09 |
| **Where** | Windows Ollama |
| **What** | Measuring whether a role-separated critic (B) can detect assertion flaws from another agent (A) |
| **Why** | Gate judgment before building A-B-C pipeline. PASS if detection rate >50%, ABANDON A-B-C if <20% |
| **How** | B provided with A's assertions + original question. Judgment requested: "Is this assertion valid?" 3 flaw types × 15 trials |

**Results:**

| Flaw type | Detection rate | vs Self-validation (Exp03) |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|
| corrupt_content | 9/9 (100%) | 0% → 100% |
| contradiction | 3/3 (100%) | 0% → 100% |
| inflate_confidence | 0/3 (0%) | 0% → 0% (metadata undetectable) |
| **Total** | **12/15 (80%)** | **0% → 80%** |

**Gate verdict: PASS** (80% > 50% threshold)

**Key Findings:**
1. **Same E4B can validate when role-separated** — Self-validation 0% → cross-validation 80%
2. Content-based flaws (arithmetic, logic errors) accurately detected with rationale
3. Metadata flaws (confidence manipulation) undetectable → orchestrator rule-based handling
4. Not a simple prompt effect but a structural difference (0%→80%)

**Conclusion:** Cross-validation effective. Basis for proceeding with A-B-C pipeline secured.

### Exp04: A-B-C Serial Pipeline

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 3 roles (A=Proposer, B=Critic, C=Judge) |
| **When** | 2026-04-09 |
| **Where** | Windows Ollama |
| **What** | Validating whether E4B 3-role separation can operate a full reasoning pipeline without a Python orchestrator |
| **Why** | Exp02 required Python to force phase transitions, but the original hypothesis is "E4B × 3 serial structure." Testing whether C (Judge) can autonomously decide phase transitions |
| **How** | A→B→C serial calls. C judges B's criticism convergence to decide phase transition. Python handles safety nets only (MAX_CYCLES). 4 tasks × 3 trials = 12 runs |

**Results:**

| Metric | Exp04 | vs Exp02 v2 |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Convergence rate | 12/12 (100%) | 17/18 (94.4%) |
| Accuracy | 10/12 (83.3%) | 17/18 (94.4%) |
| C autonomous phase transition | 30/30 (100%) | Python forced |
| Python safety net triggered | 0 times | — |

**synthesis-02 failure (2/3):** `final_answer=None` — A's prompt issue, not C's. C correctly judged CONVERGED.

**Key Findings:**
1. **C completely replaces Python orchestrator** — 30/30 autonomous decisions, 0 safety net triggers
2. Each role's complexity is within E4B's capability range: A (reasoning), B (comparison), C (pattern matching)
3. Python exists as safety net only — judgment role removed

**Conclusion:** Original hypothesis "E4B × 3 serial structure" holds. However, structured output from A is required.

### Exp05a: Prompt Enhancement

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 3 (A-B-C) |
| **When** | 2026-04-10 |
| **Where** | Windows Ollama |
| **What** | Attempting to fix Exp04's synthesis-02 `final_answer=None` problem with prompt enhancement ("MUST set final_answer") |
| **Why** | synthesis-02: A doesn't generate the final answer. Testing if "stronger instructions" resolve this |
| **How** | Added "MUST set final_answer" emphasis to A's system prompt. Re-run with same taskset |

**Result:** synthesis-02 still fails. Prompt enhancement ineffective.

**Scoring:** v1=0.636, v2=0.583

**Key Findings:**
1. **"Try harder" is ineffective** — Structural problems require structural solutions
2. This failure directly motivated Exp045 (Handoff Protocol) design

**Conclusion:** Prompt enhancement failed → pivoted to output schema enforcement.

---

### Exp045: Handoff Protocol (Information Transfer Protocol)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 3 (A-B-C) + Handoff schema |
| **When** | 2026-04-13 ~ 2026-04-14 |
| **Where** | Windows Ollama |
| **What** | Suppressing information loss between agents with structured Handoff format (HandoffA2B: blueprint, prioritized_focus, constraints) and handling hard tasks |
| **Why** | Resolving Exp04's synthesis-02 failure (structural issue) + securing information transfer stability before Exp05b scale-up |
| **How** | JSON Mode + Temperature 0.1. 6 tasks (existing 4 + 2 additional logic) × 3 trials = 18 runs. Handoff Loss Rate and Backprop Accuracy measured |

**Results:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Convergence rate | 18/18 (100%) |
| Accuracy | 18/18 (100%) |
| Handoff Loss Rate (average) | 26.4% |
| Backprop Accuracy (average) | 9.5% |

**Loss Rate by Difficulty:**

| Difficulty | Loss Rate | Task examples |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Medium | 19.5~22.9% | math-01, logic-01, synthesis-01 |
| Hard | 39.8~47.3% | math-02, logic-02 |

**Key Findings:**
1. **synthesis-02 problem completely resolved** — via schema enforcement, not instruction emphasis
2. JSON Mode + Temperature 0.1 eliminates 99% of parsing errors
3. **System converges through repetition, not feedback propagation (backprop 9.5%)**
4. E4B complexity ceiling confirmed for Hard tasks (logic-02: 47.3% loss)

**Conclusion:** Output structure enforcement > prompt enhancement. 100% accuracy achieved. Complexity ceiling exists for Hard tasks.

### Exp05b: Task Difficulty Scale-up (Stress Test)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 3 (A-B-C) + Handoff Protocol |
| **When** | 2026-04-14 |
| **Where** | Windows Ollama |
| **What** | Scale-up with expanded taskset (9 tasks: existing 6 + 3 hard types) × 5 trials = 45 runs |
| **Why** | Verifying whether Exp045's 100% accuracy holds with increased task variety and difficulty |
| **How** | Added math-03, logic-03, synthesis-03. 5 repetitions per task for statistical reliability |

**Results:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall accuracy | 40/45 (88.9%) |
| New hard 3 types | 14/15 (93.3%) |
| Weakest task | logic-02: 2/5 (40%) |
| Handoff Loss Rate | 20.3% |
| Backprop Accuracy | 25.9% |

**Scoring:** v1=0.649, v2=0.900

**Key Findings:**
1. High accuracy maintained even with hard tasks (93.3%)
2. logic-02 (contradiction detection + inclusion-exclusion) is the only weak point (40%)
3. Statistical reliability secured with 5 repetitions

**Conclusion:** A-B-C + Handoff extensible to hard difficulty. Only logic-02 type is at E4B's limit.

### Exp06: Solo-Budget Comparison (Synergy Measurement) — Closed (reconciled 2026-04-29)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 1 (Solo: same compute budget) |
| **When** | 2026-04-15 |
| **Where** | Windows Ollama |
| **What** | Performance comparison when giving a single agent the same compute budget as A-B-C |
| **Why** | Distinguishing whether A-B-C's advantage is "role-separation synergy" or "simple repetition effect." Same budget → performance difference = structural synergy |
| **How** | Solo: E4B × 1 given same loop budget as ABC. 9 tasks × 5 trials = **45 runs** (same as ABC) |

**Results (v1/v2/v3 reconciled comparison, 45 vs 45):**

| Scorer | Solo (45 trials) | ABC (45 trials) | Δ (Solo−ABC) |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| v1 (partial score) | 0.663 | 0.649 | +0.015 |
| v2 (keyword group) | 0.967 | 0.900 | +0.067 |
| v3 (neg+keyword) | 0.967 | 0.900 | +0.067 |

95% CI (bootstrap N=10,000): v1 Solo [0.573, 0.748] vs ABC [0.553, 0.737] — overlapping, difference not statistically significant.

**Disclosure (2026-04-29 reconciliation):**
- Prior record "Solo sample 9" was a **factual error** — Solo = 9 tasks × 5 trials = 45 trials, equal to ABC.
- Prior comparison "ABC 88.9% > Solo 66.3%" (+22.6pp): exact origin unclear. Partial reproductions found:
  - trial-level `v1 > 0.2` → ABC 40/45 = **88.9%** (Solo same threshold: 41/45 = 91.1%)
  - task-level `v2 mean ≥ 0.75` → ABC **8/9 = 88.9%** (logic-02 only fails)
- v2 keyword matching may overestimate Solo accuracy (checks keyword presence, not answer correctness)

**Key Findings (reconciled):**
1. All reproducible scorers (v1/v2/v3) show Solo ≥ ABC — ABC accuracy advantage not confirmed
2. **Solo premature convergence** — avg 4.5 loops vs ABC 21.6 calls. Converges quickly without external critique
3. ABC scores perfect on logic-01 (5/5); Solo has 1 failure (4/5) — ABC robustness on complex reasoning
4. CI overlap → difference may not be statistically significant on this task set

**Conclusion:** H4 Inconclusive on this 9-task set. Structural difference between architectures is real (loop count, critique mechanism), but accuracy delta is not observed here. Expanded task set or harder task subset needed to re-assess H4.

**H4 recheck note (2026-05-02):**

A follow-up plan (`exp06-h4-recheck-expanded-taskset-pre-exp11`) re-evaluated H4 with an expanded task set (12 → 15 tasks: planning-01, planning-02, synthesis-05 added) and a 3-condition ablation (Solo-1call / Solo-budget / ABC, max_cycles=8) — 225 trials total, executed 2026-05-01 ~ 2026-05-02 with Stage 2A healthcheck/abort and Stage 2B FailureLabel infrastructure.

Ablation results (n=15 task paired):
- Multi-loop effect (solo_budget − solo_1call): **+0.0700** (H1 reaffirmed)
- Role-separation effect (abc − solo_budget): **+0.0444** (H4 main hypothesis)
- Combined (abc − solo_1call): **+0.1144**

Condition mean / median per-task: Solo-1call 0.6444 / 0.667, Solo-budget 0.7144 / 0.867, **ABC 0.7589 / 1.000**.

Category-level Δ(abc−sb): math +0.000 (saturation) / logic −0.025 (logic-04 v3 negative_patterns effect) / **synthesis +0.140 (recovery driver)** / planning +0.033 (new 2 tasks).

Statistics (n=15 paired): Wilcoxon p=0.16, paired t-test p=0.10 (NOT SIGNIFICANT — power-limited at n=15). Cohen's d = 0.449 (medium effect). Bootstrap 95% CI Δ(abc−sb): [−0.0044, +0.0911] (zero almost included, borderline).

**H4 verdict (post-recheck): ⚠ Conditionally supported (synthesis category only).** The 9-task subset's Solo-favored direction (+0.067) reverses to ABC-favored (+0.044) when expanded to 15 tasks. The synthesis category (+0.140) is the recovery driver; logic shows a small ABC disadvantage tied to v3 negative_patterns false-positive blocking on logic-04 (ABC: "no unique solution" pattern → 0/20 strict).

Limitations: ABC's assertion turnover unmeasurable (run.py:115 stores only the final Tattoo, not cycle-by-cycle history) — flagged as a fix for the Stage 4 Exp11 plan. Statistical power is bounded by n=15 task pairs; the medium effect size suggests a larger taskset would likely reach significance.

Detail: `docs/reference/h4-recheck-analysis-2026-05-02.md`. Results: `experiments/exp_h4_recheck/results/h4_recheck_{solo_1call,solo_budget,abc}.json`.

The original Exp06 H4 ⚠ Inconclusive entry above remains unchanged (Closed-append-only policy).

### Exp07: Loop Saturation + Loop-Phase Prompts

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 3 (A-B-C) — model source switched from Ollama Q4_K_M → llama.cpp Q8_0 |
| **When** | 2026-04-23 ~ 2026-04-24 (completed via Gemini CLI / Windows) |
| **Where** | Windows + external llama.cpp GPU server (`yongseek.iptime.org:8005`, OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`) |
| **What** | 2(prompt: baseline/phase) × 4(MAX_CYCLES: 8/11/15/20) factorial design to identify loop saturation point and measure phase-specific prompt effects |
| **Why** | Starting from the question "Is 11 loops really sufficient?" The existing taskset was biased toward low difficulty (early convergence), failing to measure loop limits. Added 3 hard tasks (04-level) + variabilized MAX_CYCLES ceiling to **search for the saturation point where marginal returns converge to 0** |
| **How** | Added 3 hard tasks (math-04, logic-04, synthesis-04) → total 12 tasks. Each task × 3 trials × 8 conditions = **288 runs**. Added MAX_CYCLES and use_phase_prompt parameters to `orchestrator.py`/`config.py`, added loop_saturation branch to `run_experiment.py`, added phase-level aggregation + High-Difficulty table to measure.py |

**Results (accuracy, substring-based — exp07_report.md):**

| MAX_CYCLES | Baseline accuracy | Phase accuracy | Δ (Phase − Base) | Baseline convergence | Phase convergence |
|------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 8  | 79.2% | 83.8% | +4.6pp  | 91.7%  | 100.0% |
| 11 | 86.6% | 83.8% | −2.8pp  | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| 15 | 81.5% | **88.0%** | **+6.5pp** | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| 20 | 80.1% | 85.6% | +5.6pp  | 100.0% | 100.0% |

**Hard (04) Tasks:**

| Task | Best accuracy | Best condition | Average cycles |
|------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| logic-04     | 100.0% | baseline_11 | 7.0 |
| math-04      | **50.0%** | baseline_11 | 6.0 |
| synthesis-04 | 100.0% | baseline_11 | 7.0 |

**actual_cycles Distribution (all conditions, 288 trial raw data):**

| Condition | Average actual_cycles |
|-----------|----------------------|
| baseline_8  | 7.00 |
| baseline_11 | 7.00 |
| baseline_15 | 6.89 |
| baseline_20 | 6.86 |
| phase_8     | 7.03 |
| phase_11    | 6.97 |
| phase_15    | 7.11 |
| phase_20    | 7.00 |

**Key Findings:**
1. **Saturation point is actual_cycles ≈ 7, not MAX_CYCLES** — Even with ceiling at 15 or 20, actual cycles stabilize at approximately 7. C (Judge)'s convergence decision always precedes "budget exhaustion."
2. **H5 partially rejected** — "Ceiling increase = accuracy increase" does not hold. MAX_CYCLES=11 gives best baseline (86.6%), slightly decreasing at 15/20. The ceiling itself is a "safety net," not a function of accuracy.
3. **H6 partially supported** — Phase-specific prompts have a +5~6pp advantage over baseline **only in long loops (15, 20)**. In short loops (11) they are −2.8pp. Interpretation: phase guidance is "unnecessary for short reasoning, drift-suppressing for long reasoning."
4. **math-04 wall** — Multi-step mathematical reasoning (04-level) cannot exceed 50% under any loop or prompt condition. logic-04/synthesis-04 achieve 100% in all conditions. → Math reasoning limit is not resolved by structural improvement. **※ Exp08 correction**: This "50%" was an artifact from **scoring data flaws**. The `taskset.json`'s `expected_answer="X=30,Y=30,Z=10,profit=$2800"` violated the material constraint (3·30+2·30+1·10=160 > 150 kg), making it an infeasible solution. With the corrected answer (X=31, Y=10, Z=37, profit=$3060), math-04 baseline in Exp08 was **0%**. E4B essentially cannot solve this LP problem without tools.
5. **Convergence rate nearly uniform** — Only baseline_8 at 91.7%; remaining 7 conditions at 100%. Q8_0 switch + loop headroom stabilizes convergence.
6. **Infrastructure switch effects** — Q4_K_M (Ollama) → Q8_0 (llama.cpp) doubles model precision. Base quality for the same tasks (math-01~03, logic-01~03, synthesis-01~03) may have improved vs prior experiments. **Direct comparison with Exp05b requires caution.**

**Conclusion:**
- **Loop count increases yield no further gains** — E4B A-B-C structure's cycle saturation point is approximately 7.
- **Phase prompts act as "cost-free safety margin"** — Drift-suppression effect in long loops.
- **Next bottleneck is task-intrinsic complexity (math-04), not loops.**
- Operational default: `MAX_CYCLES=11, use_phase_prompt=True` recommended (phase_11: low-cost, high-stability).

**Known Issues:**
- `experiments/results/exp07_report.md` saved as UTF-16 LE (Windows PowerShell `>` redirect default encoding). UTF-8 enforcement needed in `measure.py` output path or run script — pending cleanup. **Fundamentally resolved in Exp08 with `--output` option introduction.**

### Exp08: Math Tool-Use (calculator + linalg + linprog)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 3 (A-B-C) + 3 external math tools injected into A path only. B/C have no tools. |
| **When** | 2026-04-24 (completed via Gemini CLI / Windows) |
| **Where** | Windows + external llama.cpp GPU server (`yongseek.iptime.org:8005`, OpenAI-compatible tool_calls path) |
| **What** | H7 validation — "Do external math tools compensate for E4B's computational limits?" And identifying the true cause of Exp07's math-04 50% stagnation. |
| **Why** | Exp07 showed math-04 completely stuck at 50% across all 8 conditions → confirmed structural wall not breakable by loops/prompts. llama.cpp server's `supports_tools: true` capability + confirmation that `scipy.linprog` can correctly solve the LP problem informed the experimental design. |
| **How** | **Incidental finding**: During design, discovered the existing `taskset.json`'s math-04 `expected_answer="X=30, Y=30, Z=10, profit=$2800"` violated the material constraint (material 160 > 150). Corrected to the true optimal solution X=31, Y=10, Z=37, profit=$3060 (commit `6c6f198`). Experiment: 2 arms (baseline_phase15 / tooluse_phase15) × 4 math tasks (math-01~04) × 5 trials = **40 runs**. MAX_CYCLES=15, use_phase_prompt=True fixed. Tools: `calculator` (AST whitelist eval), `solve_linear_system` (numpy), `linprog` (scipy HiGHS). |

**Results (v2 scoring):**

| Arm | Accuracy (v2) | Accuracy (v1) | Avg Cycles | Tool Calls / Errors |
|-----|---------------|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| baseline_phase15 | 0.72 | 0.64 | 7.8 | — |
| **tooluse_phase15** | **0.90** | **0.75** | **7.2** | **18 / 4** |
| **Δ (v2)** | **+0.183 (+18.3pp)** | +0.11 | −0.6 | — |

**Per-Task:**

| Task | Baseline | Tool-use | Δ | Average tool_calls |
|------|----------|----------|---|--------------------|
| math-01 | 1.00 | 1.00 | ±0 | 1.6 |
| math-02 | 1.00 | 1.00 | ±0 | 0.8 |
| math-03 | 0.87 | 0.80 | −0.07 (noise, both sides have "inconsistent" correct answers) | — |
| **math-04** | **0.00** | **0.80** | **+0.80** | 1.0 |

**Tool Success Rates:**

| Tool | Calls | Errors | Success rate | Primary errors |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `linprog` | 5 | 0 | 100% | — |
| `solve_linear_system` | 7 | 1 | 86% | `Singular matrix` 1 case (model misidentified LP as simultaneous equations) |
| `calculator` | 6 | 3 | 50% | `BitXor` 3 cases (model used `^` for exponentiation — Python meaning is XOR) |

**Key Findings:**
1. **H7 supported** — Overall accuracy +18.3pp, decisive breakthrough especially at math-04: 0% → 80% (+80pp).
2. **Exp07 interpretation overturned** — Full review of math-04 baseline 5 trials: 4 had `final_answer=None` (10~11 cycles without generating answer), 1 had wrong answer `X=25, Y=10, Z=35, profit=2700`. E4B essentially cannot solve this LP problem without tools. Exp07's 50% was a scoring artifact from wrong expected_answer (X=30,Y=30,Z=10,profit=2800) partial substring matching.
3. **Gemento hypothesis reconfirmed** — "Small LLM + external state (tattoo)" design pattern naturally extends to "Small LLM + external tools (tool_calls)". The design principle "break structural limits with external resources" holds in both dimensions.
4. **Tool side effect 1 — Tool neglect** — In math-04 tooluse trial 2, model made 0 tool calls (tc=0) and returned `None` after 10 cycles despite tools being available. Tool existence doesn't guarantee use → prompt or `tool_choice` strategy needed.
5. **Tool side effect 2 — Calculator `^` confusion** — Model misinterprets Python `^` (XOR) as mathematical exponentiation, generating expressions like `2^10`. AST whitelist correctly blocks this, but error message ("Disallowed operator: BitXor") is not helpful to the model. Improvement: add hint or preprocess `^` to `**`.
6. **math-03 "decline" is noise** — Full answer review confirms both baseline/tooluse correctly conclude "the problem is inconsistent." Difference is keyword matching variation in expression (particularly one Korean response affects v2). No actual performance difference.
7. **Average cycle decrease** — Baseline 7.8 → Tooluse 7.2. Tools induce earlier convergence. Particularly striking for math-04: baseline 10~11 cycles (all failures) vs tooluse 7~8 cycles (mostly successful).

**Conclusion:**
- **H7 fully supported**. External tools break E4B's **structural computational limits** (especially optimization).
- Gemento's original design principle ("compensate limits with external resources") proven effective in the tool dimension.
- Exp07's math-04 interpretation was **error due to scoring data flaws** — highlighting the need for expected_answer validation procedures in research pipelines.

**Known Issues / Follow-up:**
- Calculator `^` BitXor confusion → error message improvement or preprocessing. **→ Resolved in Exp08b.**
- Tool neglect pattern → tool_choice strategy or prompt reinforcement. **→ Resolved in Exp08b.**
- math-03 Korean response + v2 scoring matching verification needed.
- This experiment is **not directly comparable with Exp07** (math-04 expected_answer changed, same Q8_0 environment but taskset modified).

### Exp08b: Tool-Use Refinement (Error Hints + Mandatory Rules)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 3 (A-B-C) + improved tools + reinforced SYSTEM_PROMPT |
| **When** | 2026-04-24 (completed via Gemini CLI / Windows) |
| **Where** | Windows + external llama.cpp GPU server |
| **What** | H8 validation — Re-measurement after mitigating the 2 side effects discovered in Exp08 (calculator `^` confusion, tool neglect) |
| **Why** | Exp08 result was H7 supported, but 2 side effects limited operational stability. (a) calculator BitXor 3/6 failures, (b) math-04 trial 2: failed without calling any tools. Validating whether these 2 can be resolved with minimally invasive improvements |
| **How** | (1) Added "use `**` for power; Python `^` is bitwise XOR" hint for `BitXor` case in `_eval()` in `experiments/tools/math_tools.py`. (2) Added 4 Mandatory rules to Tool use section of `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `experiments/system_prompt.py` (mandatory linprog call for LP, `^` prohibited, mandatory retry after error, fabrication prohibited). (3) Added `tool-use-refined` command to `run_experiment.py` for 2 arms × 4 math tasks × 5 trials = **40 runs** same setting re-measurement. (4) Added `tool_neglect_rate` metric to `measure.py:analyze_tool_use` |

**Results (v2 scoring):**

| Arm | Accuracy (v2) | Accuracy (v1) | Avg Cycles | Tool Calls / Errors |
|-----|---------------|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| baseline_refined | 0.73 | 0.53 | 8.0 | — |
| **tooluse_refined** | **0.97** | **0.77** | **6.9** | **37 / 6** |
| **Δ (v2)** | **+0.233 (+23.3pp)** | +0.24 | −1.1 | — |

**Per-Task (v2):**

| Task | Baseline | Tool-use | Δ | Average tool_calls |
|------|----------|----------|---|--------------------|
| math-01 | 1.00 | 1.00 | ±0 | 1.8 |
| math-02 | 1.00 | 1.00 | ±0 | 2.2 |
| math-03 | 0.93 | 0.87 | −0.07 | 1.4 |
| **math-04** | **0.00** | **1.00** | **+1.00** | 2.0 |

**Tool Success Rates:**

| Tool | Calls | Errors | Success rate | Change (Exp08 → Exp08b) |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| `calculator` | 16 | 0 | **1.00** | 0.50 → **1.00** (BitXor hint completely successful) |
| `solve_linear_system` | 12 | 6 | 0.50 | 0.86 → 0.50 (increased calls expose errors, all math-03 Singular matrix) |
| `linprog` | 9 | 0 | **1.00** | 1.00 → 1.00 (maintained) |

**Side Effect Resolution Status:**

| Target | Exp08 | Exp08b | Goal | Achieved |
|--------|-------|--------|------|---------|
| Calculator success rate | 0.50 | **1.00** | ≥0.85 | ✅ Exceeded |
| Tool Neglect Rate | 0.20 (1/5) | **0.00 (0/20)** | 0.00 | ✅ Exact |
| Tooluse arm accuracy | 0.90 | **0.97** | ≥0.95 | ✅ Exceeded |
| math-04 accuracy | 0.80 | **1.00 (5/5)** | — | ✅ Complete |

**Key Findings:**
1. **H8 fully supported** — All 3 targets achieved/exceeded. Additional +7pp improvement over Exp08 (90%→97%).
2. **math-04 complete success** — What was 4/5 in Exp08 (trial 2 neglect) becomes **5/5 all correct** (31, 10, 37, 3060). "Mandatory linprog call for LP" rule completely blocks tool neglect.
3. **Calculator BitXor completely resolved** — What was 6 calls with 3 failures (50%) in Exp08 becomes **16 calls all successful**. Direct evidence that error hint successfully corrected the model's **retry direction**.
4. **Avg Cycles decrease** — Baseline 8.0 vs tooluse 6.9. Tools and Mandatory rules induce **early convergence**. Even shorter than Exp08 tooluse (7.2).
5. **Exp07 interpretation reconfirmed** — math-04 baseline is 0% (same as Exp08). The conclusion "Exp07's 50% stagnation was a scoring data artifact" is independently reconfirmed.
6. **math-03 0.93 → 0.87**: 0.07 decrease after tool introduction vs baseline. Content of both sides correctly concludes "problem is inconsistent" — interpreted as noise range.
7. **solve_linear_system Singular matrix 6 cases**: All math-03 (inconsistent problem). Model attempts simultaneous equations approach and tool correctly returns "singular matrix." Not a tool issue — **natural exploration path for inconsistent problems**. Converges to "inconsistent" conclusion. Not an operational issue.

**Conclusion:**
- **H8 fully supported**. Error hints + Mandatory rules — **minimally invasive prompt/feedback-level improvements** — produce 97% accuracy.
- Even small models can achieve inference stability comparable to much larger models when **orchestration (rules) and precise tool utilization** are combined.
- Additional evidence for Gemento's design principle ("compensate limits with external resources + deterministic constraints elevate non-deterministic quality").

**Known Issues / Follow-up:**
- **solve_linear_system error hint candidate** — Adding "data may be inconsistent" hint to "Singular matrix" error could accelerate model's "inconsistent problem" judgment. Verifiable experiment (Exp08c candidate).
- math-03 Korean response + v2 scoring variance remains — independent issue.
- **Next is Exp09** — Exp08b's success is evidence limited to "single task, single inference." Next step: Long-context stress / stream workflow / cross-model.

### Exp09: Long-Context Stress Test (ABC vs Solo-dump vs RAG)

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B × 3 (A-B-C) + Tattoo evidence_ref + new longctx taskset |
| **When** | 2026-04-25 (completed via Gemini CLI / Windows) |
| **Where** | Windows + external llama.cpp GPU server (n_ctx 8K × 4 slots) |
| **What** | H9 validation — Direct measurement of Gemento's **original core hypothesis** ("extend effective context with external state"). Does Gemento ABC + Tattoo (a) outperform Solo-dump and (b) show unique contribution over standard RAG baseline? |
| **Why** | Until now, H1·H4·H7·H8 compensate "computational/reasoning" limits with externalization tools. But the **context itself's** limit has never been directly measured. Exp09 frontally validates this hypothesis with documents 20~40× larger than sliding_window(512). RAG comparison also measured to block "Gemento = just RAG + loop" counterargument |
| **How** | New taskset `experiments/tasks/longctx_taskset.json` (10 tasks, 3 size classes × 3 hop types). 3 arms × 10 tasks × 3 trials = **90 runs**. Arms: (1) `solo_dump` — entire document + question single call, truncation if n_ctx exceeded, (2) `rag_baseline` — `bm25s` top-K=5 chunks single call, (3) `abc_tattoo` — chunk iteration + evidence_ref accumulation + final B+C convergence. New infrastructure: `tools/chunker.py`, `tools/bm25_tool.py`, `Assertion.evidence_ref` field, `run_abc_chunked()`, `analyze_longctx` + error mode taxonomy |

**Results (v2 scoring, 90 runs):**

| Arm | Accuracy v2 | Accuracy v1 | Errors |
|-----|-------------|-------------|--------|
| solo_dump | 0.20 | 0.20 | 24/30 (format_error) |
| rag_baseline | 0.85 | 0.90 | 0 |
| **abc_tattoo** | **0.88** | **0.93** | 0 |

**Key Deltas (v2):**
- **H9a (abc − solo)**: **+68.3pp** ✅ Overwhelmingly supported
- **H9b (abc − rag)**: **+3.3pp** ✅ Partially supported (marginal overall, but +33pp differentiation clear in 3-hop)

**Size Class Breakdown — Physical Limit Breakthrough Validation:**

| Arm | Small 3K | Medium 10K | Large 20K |
|-----|---------|-----------|----------|
| solo_dump | 1.00 | **0.00** | **0.00** |
| rag_baseline | 1.00 | 0.88 | 0.75 |
| **abc_tattoo** | **0.67** | 0.88 | **1.00** |

**Hop Type Breakdown — Origin of H9b Differentiation:**

| Arm | needle | 2-hop | 3-hop |
|-----|--------|-------|-------|
| solo_dump | 0.33 | 0.25 | 0.00 |
| rag_baseline | 1.00 | 0.88 | 0.67 |
| **abc_tattoo** | 0.78 | 0.88 | **1.00** |

**Per-Task Highlights:**

- `longctx-large-3hop-01`: solo 0% / **rag 0%** / **abc 100%** — Single task providing empirical evidence of RAG's information fragmentation.
- `longctx-small-needle-01`: solo 1.00 / rag 1.00 / **abc 0.33** — Core case of Small Paradox.

**Error Modes (H9c):**

| Arm | Primary failure pattern |
|-----|------------------------|
| solo_dump | `format_error` 24 cases — incomplete responses due to n_ctx exceeded truncation |
| rag_baseline | `wrong_synthesis` 6 cases — retrieval correct but integration failed |
| abc_tattoo | `evidence_miss` 2 + `wrong_synthesis` 3 cases — different pattern due to validation path |

**Evidence Hit Rate (ABC arm):**
- Overall: 0.35
- needle 0.33 / 2-hop 0.50 / **3-hop 0.23**
- Interesting asymmetry: 3-hop has the lowest hit rate but 100% accuracy. Hypothesis: "Rationalizing through the validation path" impacts accuracy more than "finding all necessary evidence."

**Key Findings:**
1. **H9a overwhelmingly supported** — Solo completely collapses at Medium and above **(0%)**, ABC achieves **100%** at Large 20K. The single most powerful evidence for Gemento's original hypothesis ("external state expands effective context").
2. **H9b partially supported — differentiation occurs in 3-hop** — needle/2-hop nearly equivalent with RAG (±0~12pp). **Only 3-hop: ABC 100% vs RAG 67% (+33pp)**. "Gemento ≠ just RAG + loop" holds **only in multi-evidence integration contexts**.
3. **H9c supported** — 3 arms' failure modes are qualitatively different (truncation vs information fragmentation vs post-validation residual errors).
4. **Small Paradox new discovery** — ABC weaker than RAG in small (0.67 vs 1.00). May be sample noise, or actual paradox (cycle iteration overkill when chunks are few). Exp10 candidate explicitly noted.
5. **Solo monotonic collapse** — 1.00 (small) → 0.00 (medium) → 0.00 (large). Truncation immediately leads to failure from the moment n_ctx 8K is approached. Model cannot normalize chunk-truncated responses.

**Conclusion:**
- **Gemento's original core hypothesis (context limit externalization) frontally proven**. The single most powerful evidence for the Tattoo (state externalization) axis among the 4-axis externalization principles in conceptFramework § 1.
- Counterargument "Gemento = RAG + loop" blocked — but differentiation is **limited to the multi-evidence integration domain**. RAG is sufficient for simple retrieval like needle.
- **Next candidates (Exp10+)**: Small Paradox resolution, parallel chunk traversal (Gemini handoff recommendation), Stream Workflow (long-term processing).

**Known Issues / Follow-up:**
- **Small Paradox** — ABC 0.33 in one small needle task. Small sample (small=2 tasks × 3 trials = 6 data points) may be noise. Additional trials or expanded small tasks needed for verification.
- **Evidence Hit Rate ↔ Accuracy asymmetry** — 3-hop hit 0.23 but 100% accuracy. Model may tend to attach non-answer chunks to evidence_ref, or gold_evidence_chunks labeling may be too strict. Separate analysis needed.
- **Statistical test completed (Phase 1, 5-trial)** — paired t-test p=0.7976, Wilcoxon p=1.000 → **NOT SIGNIFICANT**. H9b verdict changed from "Partially supported" to "Inconclusive".

#### Statistical Final Results (Phase 1, 2026-04-30)

Based on 5 trials × 10 tasks (50 data points/arm):

| Test | Statistic | p-value | Verdict |
|------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Paired t-test (task mean, n=10) | t=0.264 | 0.7976 | NOT SIGNIFICANT |
| Wilcoxon signed-rank | W=1.0 | 1.000 | NOT SIGNIFICANT |

- Overall mean: abc=0.530, rag=0.510 (Δ=+0.020)
- Cohen's d = 0.084 (negligible effect size)
- Bootstrap 95% CI for Δ(abc−rag): [−0.170, 0.210] (includes zero)

> **Interpretation**: n=10 tasks is underpowered. NOT SIGNIFICANT ≠ "no effect" — means "insufficient data to determine". Overall Δ=+2.0pp is not practically meaningful.

Size class / Hop type breakdown (5-trial):
- small tasks (n=2): abc=0.400 vs rag=0.600 (Δ=−0.200) ◄ **Small Paradox confirmed**
- medium tasks (n=4): abc=0.525 vs rag=0.525 (Δ=0.000)
- large tasks (n=4): abc=0.600 vs rag=0.450 (Δ=+0.150)
- 3-hop tasks (n=3): abc=0.600 vs rag=0.400 (Δ=+0.200) ← differentiation persists
- needle tasks (n=3): abc=0.467 vs rag=0.600 (Δ=−0.133)

Small Paradox detail:
- `longctx-small-needle-01`: abc=0.200 vs rag=0.600 (Δ=−0.400, trials=[0,0,1,0,0])
- `longctx-small-2hop-01`: abc=0.600 vs rag=0.600 (Δ=0.000, trials=[1,1,1,0,0])

**5-trial drop analysis note (2026-04-30):**

Follow-up analysis after the Phase 1 5-trial publication revealed that trials 4-5 are infrastructure-invalid, not statistically meaningful additional samples. On the Windows execution environment, the model server (`http://yongseek.iptime.org:8005`) returned `WinError 10061` (connection refused) for all rag/solo trials 4-5 (20/20 each), and ABC trials 4-5 returned `num_assertions=0, final_answer=null` (20/20) because the ABC orchestrator's try/except swallowed the connection failure into an empty result.

Validation: `3-trial mean × 3/5` matches the 5-trial mean exactly — `0.883 × 0.6 = 0.530` (abc), `0.850 × 0.6 = 0.510` (rag). No new sampling variance or model nondeterminism. Trial 1-3 answers are 10/10 task-identical between the 3-trial and 5-trial JSON (append consistency 100%).

**Implication for H9b**: the 5-trial NOT SIGNIFICANT verdict (paired t-test p=0.7976, Wilcoxon p=1.000) is dilution by invalid trials, not evidence of no effect. The 3-trial result (Δ=+0.033) remains the most accurate H9b data point. Verdict reversion is a follow-up architectural decision; this note disclosures the data flaw only.

Detail: `docs/reference/exp09-5trial-drop-analysis-2026-04-30.md`. Analysis script: `experiments/exp09_longctx/analyze_5trial_drop.py`. `run_append_trials.py` retry / pre-flight healthcheck reinforcement is a separate plan candidate.

### Exp10: Reproducibility & Cost Profile (v2 final)

| Item | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Who** | Gemma 4 E4B (LM Studio Q4_K_M) × ABC 8-loop vs Gemma 4 E4B single-pass vs Gemini 2.5 Flash 1-call |
| **When** | 2026-04-28 (Windows main run) → 2026-04-29 (Mac retry/merge/finalize) |
| **Where** | Windows + LM Studio (gemma_8loop, gemma_1loop) + Google AI Studio (gemini_flash_1call) |
| **What** | Three-axis cost-aware comparison (accuracy + cost + latency). 3 conditions × 9 tasks × N=20 trials = **540 trials** |
| **Why** | Direct measurement of "Does Gemento ABC surpass closed-source large 1-call?". Same-model 1-loop vs 8-loop comparison provides additional direct evidence for H1 (external state + iteration) |
| **How** | gemma_8loop = ABC + max_cycles=15 + use_phase_prompt=True. gemma_1loop = single-pass. gemini_flash_1call = response_mime_type=application/json. Two artifact patches applied to v2 main result — `(gemma_8loop, math-04)` 20 trials substituted with use_tools=True debug rerun, `(gemini_flash, logic-04)` 4 timeout trials substituted with timeout=300s retry |

**Results (strict scoring, 540 trials):**

| condition | mean_acc | cost / 180 trials | avg_dur | err+null |
|-----------|---------:|------------------:|--------:|---------:|
| **gemma_8loop** | **0.781** | $0.0000 | 8 min | 8 |
| gemini_flash_1call | 0.591 | $0.0143 | 24 s | 0 |
| gemma_1loop | 0.413 | $0.0000 | 33 s | 11 |

**Key Findings:**
1. **H1 direct evidence — external state + iteration** — Same model 1-loop → 8-loop went 0.413 → 0.781 (**+37%p**). ABC chain nearly doubles model capability. Measured under identical weight, quantization, and sampling parameters, so the gain is attributable to inference structure alone, not model substitution.
2. **Small local vs closed-source large** — gemma_8loop (4.5B) surpasses Gemini 2.5 Flash by **+19%p** in accuracy. Cost $0, but 1/20 the speed (8 min vs 24 s).
3. **logic-04 false positive (scoring system limitation)** — v2 substring scoring gave 0.400 (gemma_8loop) / 0.250 (flash) but the body text was "no solution"/"contradiction" pattern, so strict acc was 0.050 / 0.000. 13/60 trials were false positives. Condition ranking unchanged, but scoring system reinforcement is a decisive follow-up.
4. **Local model ceiling (logic-04)** — Strict acc ≤ 0.05 across all conditions. Even ABC 8-loop cannot crack 4-suspect proof-by-contradiction. Tooling or multi-stage prompting needed.
5. **math-04 tool policy decisive** — use_tools=False yielded 0/20 (full failure), True yielded 20/20 (linprog call). Not a model capability limit but a system policy limit. Tool policy must be unified across the math category in future runs.
6. **ABC infrastructure 4 fails** — gemma_8loop 4 trials hit JSON parse failures (math-03 t13, synthesis-01 t14, logic-04 t2/t6). Infrastructure stability issue, not model capability.

**Detail report:** `docs/reference/results/exp-10-reproducibility-cost.md`
**Data:** `experiments/exp10_reproducibility_cost/results/exp10_v2_final_20260429_033922.json`
**Patch procedure:** `docs/reference/exp10-v2-finalize-2026-04-29.md`

**v3 rescore note (2026-04-29):**

After publishing the v2 final results above, a follow-up scorer (`score_answer_v3`) was introduced to address logic-04 false positives caused by substring-only matching. The v3 scorer adds optional `negative_patterns` per task to block "no solution / contradiction" type answers from being scored as correct. Re-scoring the same 540-trial v2 final dataset:

| condition | v2 mean | v3 mean |
|-----------|--------:|--------:|
| gemma_8loop | 0.820 | 0.781 |
| gemini_flash_1call | 0.619 | 0.591 |
| gemma_1loop | 0.413 | 0.413 |

Ranking unchanged. The v2 final dataset itself is preserved; only the scoring layer changed. ABC chain JSON parse stability also patched in `extract_json_from_response` (fence_unclosed fallback + partial JSON brace recovery), applied to future runs.

Detail: `docs/reference/results/exp-10-reproducibility-cost.md` §6.

**v3 rescore note 2 (2026-04-30, taskset patched):**

A subsequent Phase 1 follow-up plan (`phase-1-taskset-3-fail-exp09-5-trial-exp10-v3`) repaired three FAIL items flagged by `validate_taskset` (math-03 prompt unsolvable system → 96→88 + "round = square + 2" constraint, synthesis-04 keyword groups → `[["reports"],["5"],["6"]]`, longctx-medium-2hop-02 expected → `"500 horsepower (500 hp)"`), then re-ran `rescore_v3.py` against the same v2 final dataset. New output: `exp10_v3_rescored_20260430_152306.json`.

Comparing against the prior canonical (`053939`):

| condition | prev v3 (053939) | curr v3 (152306) | Δ |
|-----------|----------------:|-----------------:|--:|
| gemma_8loop | 0.7815 | 0.7833 | +0.0019 |
| gemini_flash_1call | 0.5907 | 0.5926 | +0.0019 |
| gemma_1loop | 0.4130 | 0.4148 | +0.0019 |

Task-level Δ is **synthesis-04 alone** (+0.017 across all three conditions, from the keyword-group simplification). math-03 unchanged at the rescore level — the v3 trials' final_answer text was generated under the unsolvable 96 prompt and does not match the corrected gold either, so the Δ is zero. logic-04 also unchanged (negative_patterns preserved). Other 7 tasks preserved.

Condition-mean |Δ| < 0.01 — no README headline / H1 evidence text update required (rounded ratios identical: gemma_1loop→8loop ≈ +37pp, gemma_8loop−gemini_flash ≈ +19pp). The 053939 file is retained as untracked archive (consistent with the prior plan's policy). Detail: `docs/reference/results/exp-10-reproducibility-cost.md` §8.

## Exp11 — Mixed Intelligence (Flash Judge) note (2026-05-03)

A follow-up experiment (`exp11-mixed-intelligence-haiku-judge` slug; Gemini 2.5 Flash Judge after v2 plan revision from Anthropic Haiku) tested **H10** — whether a stronger Judge C (Gemini 2.5 Flash) compensates for weaker Proposer/Critic (A/B = Gemma 4 E4B). Built on Stage 2C's H4 conditional support (synthesis +0.140 recovery), the experiment is the most direct test of the README's first operational principle: "role-based placement, not size-based".

Conditions: baseline_abc (all Gemma) vs mixed_flash_judge (A/B Gemma + C Flash) × 15 tasks × 5 trials = 150 trials. Stage 2A healthcheck/abort + Stage 2B FailureLabel + Stage 2C tattoo_history cycle-by-cycle fix all applied. Architect-injected `c_caller` argument to `run_abc_chain` (1-2 line patch, default=None backward-compat).

Results (v3 scoring, 150 trials):
- baseline_abc: mean_acc=0.7778, median per-task=0.9333, err+null=14, avg cycles=7.2, avg dur=437s, cost=$0
- **mixed_flash_judge**: mean_acc=**0.6967**, median per-task=0.8000, err+null=16, avg cycles=6.7, avg dur=377s, cost=**$0.0843**

Δ(mixed − baseline) = **−0.0811** (negative — Mixed *underperforms* baseline). Statistics (n=15 paired): Wilcoxon p=0.293, paired t p=0.241 (NOT SIGNIFICANT — power-limited at n=15). Cohen's d = **−0.316** (small effect, negative direction). Bootstrap 95% CI Δ: [−0.220, +0.022] (zero almost included, but negative direction dominant).

Category-level Δ(mixed−baseline):
- math: −0.050
- **logic: −0.275** (catastrophic, logic-02 0.9→0)
- **synthesis: +0.030** (only positive — aligns with Stage 2C H4 recovery region)
- planning: −0.033

**H10 verdict (Architect)**: ⚠ **Inconclusive (effectively rejected)**. The negative Δ, negative Cohen's d, and absence of the H10 mechanism (turnover_modified) in the assertion turnover analysis (mixed=0.32 vs baseline=0.28, only +0.04 difference) all point to *no support* for H10 in this dataset.

**Unexpected finding — Flash Judge *interferes with* the reasoning chain**:

The logic-02 case study (Δ=−0.900) is decisive. logic-02 contains intentionally inconsistent set-cardinality data (inclusion-exclusion sum 105 > total 100). Required keywords: `[['105', 'inconsistent'], ['0']]`.

- baseline (all Gemma): 4/5 trials produce answers explicitly stating "105" and "inconsistent" — Gemma's A/B/C self-discover the inclusion-exclusion contradiction across cycles.
- mixed (Flash Judge): 5/5 trials produce either null final_answer (max cycles reached) or short answers like "-5" or "input data set is..." without the required keywords. Flash Judge shortens cycles (avg 6.7 vs 7.2) and disrupts Gemma's self-discovery chain.

This is the *inverse* of H10's hypothesis: stronger Judge does not "compensate" weaker Proposer; instead, the Tattoo schema mismatch + premature convergence by the Judge *breaks* the weaker model's emergent reasoning. A new candidate hypothesis arises — "stronger Judge can interfere with weaker model's self-discovery when prompt schemas don't align".

**Stage 5 implications**:
- ❌ Mixed Intelligence (Role-strengthening) direction tentatively rejected — no follow-up plan recommended along this axis
- 🎯 Search Tool / Extractor / Reducer (other unexternalized axes) prioritized as Exp12 candidates
- Open follow-up: Judge prompt schema strengthening + Mixed re-validation (motivation weakened by inverse-mechanism finding)

Limitations:
- n=15 task paired — power-limited; "inconclusive" preferred over definitive rejection
- 5 trials per (task, condition) — sample-limited
- Tool axis not exercised (math-04 zero on both, use_tools=False)
- Flash's reasoning capacity not utilized (JUDGE_PROMPT requires only verdict, not analytical response)

Detail: `docs/reference/exp11-mixed-intelligence-analysis-2026-05-03.md`. Results: `experiments/exp11_mixed_intelligence/results/exp11_mixed_intelligence_20260502_143554.json` (baseline) + `exp11_mixed_flash_judge.json` (mixed).

The hypothesis table above (H1~H9c) remains unchanged (Closed-append-only policy). H10's entry is a new addition only.

## Exp12 — Extractor Role note (2026-05-04)

A follow-up experiment (`exp12-extractor-role-pre-search`) tested **H11** — whether adding a new Role (Extractor, same Gemma 4 E4B model) that pre-extracts claims/entities from the task prompt and prefixes the result into the A→B→C chain's input reduces A's burden and improves accuracy. This is the Architect-recommended direction *after* Exp11's H10 was effectively rejected with the inverse mechanism finding (a stronger Judge interferes with the weaker model's self-discovery).

Conditions: baseline_abc (all Gemma) vs extractor_abc (Extractor + ABC, all Gemma) × 15 tasks × 5 trials = 150 trials. Same model on all roles (Exp11's mismatch risk avoided). Stage 2A healthcheck/abort + Stage 2B FailureLabel + Stage 2C tattoo_history cycle-by-cycle fix + Exp11 c_caller preserved. Architect added `extractor_pre_stage` argument to `run_abc_chain` (1-2 line patch, default=False backward-compat) + new `EXTRACTOR_PROMPT` / `build_extractor_prompt()` in `system_prompt.py`.

Results (v3 scoring, 150 trials):
- baseline_abc: mean_acc=0.7500, median=1.0000, err+null=20, avg cycles=7.3, avg dur=412s
- **extractor_abc**: mean_acc=**0.8000**, median=1.0000, err+null=10, avg cycles=7.1, avg dur=425s

Δ(extractor − baseline) = **+0.0500** (positive — opposite sign from Exp11's −0.0811). Statistics (n=15 paired): Wilcoxon p=0.198, paired t p=0.231 (NOT SIGNIFICANT — power-limited). Cohen's d = **+0.323** (small effect, positive). Bootstrap 95% CI Δ: [−0.020, +0.133] (zero almost included, positive direction dominant).

Category-level Δ(ext−base):
- math: +0.000 (saturation)
- **logic: +0.125** ⬆ (logic-02 recovery +0.30 — Stage 2C / Exp11 catastrophic region)
- **synthesis: +0.050** (synthesis-05 recovery +0.45)
- planning: +0.000 (saturation)

**H11 verdict (Architect)**: ⚠ **Conditionally supported (positive direction, power-limited)**. The +0.05 threshold is met but n=15 limits significance. Cohen's d positive, all metrics consistently favor extractor (NONE 58→63, err rate 13%→7%), and the catastrophic-region recovery (logic-02 +0.30, synthesis-05 +0.45) is the most informative signal.

**Decisive contrast with Exp11 (H10)**:

| | Exp11 Mixed (H10) | Exp12 Extractor (H11) |
|---|---|---|
| Hypothesis | Strong Judge → compensates weak A/B | New Role (separation/addition), same model |
| Model | A/B Gemma + **C Flash** | **All Gemma**, Extractor newly added |
| Δ acc | **−0.0811** | **+0.0500** |
| Cohen's d | −0.316 | **+0.323** |
| logic-02 | base 0.9 → mixed 0.0 (catastrophic) | base 0.3 → ext 0.6 (recovery) |
| Mechanism | Tattoo schema mismatch + premature convergence | Cycle-1 input organization + stabilization |
| External API cost | $0.0843 (Flash) | $0 (local Gemma only) |
| Verdict | ⚠ Inconclusive (effectively rejected) | **⚠ Conditionally supported** |

The framework's Role-axis evolution direction is now clear: **strengthening (Mixed) ❌ vs separation/addition (Extractor) ✅**. The next stage candidates (Reducer Role / Search Tool) inherit this distinction — Role multiplication is preferred over model strengthening within ABC.

Limitations: n=15 task paired (power-limited); 5 trials per (task, condition); the cycle-1 mechanism is measurable only indirectly (via accuracy and error mode, not via assertion turnover, since `tattoo_history[0]` captures the empty pre-cycle Tattoo); synthesis-02 saturation broke (−0.20, a single negative case); Tool axis not exercised (math-04 zero on both).

Detail: `docs/reference/exp12-extractor-role-analysis-2026-05-04.md`. Results: `experiments/exp12_extractor_role/results/exp12_extractor_role_20260503_151724.json` (baseline) + `exp12_extractor_abc.json` (extractor).

The hypothesis table above (H1~H10) remains unchanged (Closed-append-only policy). H11's entry is a new addition only.

## Exp13 — Reducer Role note (2026-05-05)

A follow-up experiment (`exp13-reducer-role`) tested **H12** — whether adding a new Role (Reducer, same Gemma 4 E4B model) that *post-stage* polishes the final tattoo + final_answer improves keyword-match accuracy and answer clarity. This was the symmetric counterpart to Exp12's Extractor (pre-stage input organization vs post-stage output organization), Architect-recommended after Exp12's H11 conditional support.

Conditions: baseline_abc (all Gemma) vs reducer_abc (A→B→C → Reducer post-stage, all Gemma) × 15 tasks × 5 trials = 150 trials. Same model on all roles. Stage 2A healthcheck/abort + Stage 2B FailureLabel + Stage 2C tattoo_history fix + Exp11 c_caller / Exp12 extractor_pre_stage all preserved. Architect added `reducer_post_stage` argument to `run_abc_chain` (cycle loop *outside*, post-stage helper) + new `REDUCER_PROMPT` / `build_reducer_prompt()` in `system_prompt.py`. During analysis, an orchestrator bug was discovered (`len(final_answer)` failed when `final_answer` was an int) — fixed in commit `cf057b6` (one-line `isinstance` coercion). Bug affected 2/75 reducer trials (math-02 t2/t3); Δ direction unchanged.

Results (v3 scoring, 150 trials):
- baseline_abc: mean_acc=0.7744, err+null=18, avg cycles=7.2, avg dur=429s, cost=$0
- **reducer_abc**: mean_acc=**0.7033**, err+null=16 (+ 2 TypeError bug), avg cycles=7.0, avg dur=414s, cost=$0

Δ(reducer − baseline) = **−0.0711** with bug / **−0.0533** bug-excluded (negative — opposite sign from Exp12's +0.0500). Statistics (n=15 paired): Wilcoxon p=0.180, paired t p=0.204 (NOT SIGNIFICANT — power-limited). Cohen's d = **−0.344** with bug / **−0.323** bug-excluded — a near-mirror image of Exp12's +0.323. Bootstrap 95% CI Δ: [−0.176, +0.024] (zero almost included, negative direction dominant).

Category-level Δ(reducer−base):
- math: −0.083 (math-02 catastrophic 1.0→0.4, partly bug)
- **logic: −0.100** ⬇ (logic-02/04 catastrophic strengthened)
- **synthesis: −0.107** ⬇ (5/5 tasks negative — synthesis-04 −0.27 the headline case)
- planning: +0.100 (n=2, planning-02 saturation stable)

**H12 verdict (Architect)**: ⚠ **Inconclusive (effectively rejected)**. Δ exceeds the −0.05 threshold in both bug-included and bug-excluded computations, Cohen's d sits at −0.32 (mirror of Exp12), and 4 out of 4 catastrophic-region tasks worsened. The "rejected" framing is moderated to "inconclusive (effectively rejected)" because n=15 yields p>0.05 (Stage 2C / Exp11 / Exp12 power-limit pattern).

**Mechanism — abstraction loss (synthesis-04 case study)**: The decisive case is synthesis-04 (multi-source population estimate with conflicts), where baseline produces structured analyses ("## Comprehensive Analysis ... Identification of Contradictions ... Zone C Count (R5 vs R1/R6)") that hit acc=1.00, while reducer compresses to single-point estimates ("The best estimate is **270 individuals**.") that score acc=0.33–0.67. The Reducer prompt's "polish for clarity" + "do NOT change conclusion" instructions push the model toward single-answer compression — losing the multi-source / multi-estimate structure that the keyword scorer relies on. Notably, Reducer outputs are *not shorter* on average (281 chars vs baseline 230 chars); the loss is in *abstraction* (multi → single), not length.

**Decisive contrast — Exp11 / Exp12 / Exp13 mirror pattern**:

| | Exp11 Mixed (H10) | Exp12 Extractor (H11) | Exp13 Reducer (H12) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hypothesis | Strong Judge → compensates weak A/B | New Role pre-stage (input organization) | New Role post-stage (output organization) |
| Position | C strengthening | **pre-stage** | **post-stage** |
| Δ acc | −0.0811 | **+0.0500** | **−0.0533** (bug-excluded) |
| Cohen's d | −0.316 | **+0.323** | **−0.323** |
| Mechanism | chain disruption | input stabilization | abstraction loss |
| Verdict | ⚠ Inconclusive (effectively rejected) | ⚠ Conditionally supported | ⚠ Inconclusive (effectively rejected) |

The plan's core assumption (Extractor ↔ Reducer pre/post symmetry) breaks empirically. Exp12 and Exp13 produce nearly identical-magnitude effects in opposite directions — a clean mirror image. This establishes a **framework-level position-effect asymmetry**:

| Role change type | Effect | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Role *strengthening* (stronger model) | ❌ Negative (Exp11) | self-discovery chain disruption |
| Role *separation/addition* — **pre-stage** (Extractor) | ✅ Positive (Exp12) | input stabilization |
| Role *separation/addition* — **post-stage** (Reducer) | ❌ Negative (Exp13) | output abstraction loss |

The weaker model's reasoning chain is most fertile when *not interfered with*; external Role assistance must be applied with care.

**Stage 5 Exp14+ implications**:
- 🎯 Search Tool (Exp14 candidate, Tool-axis new) prioritized — Role-axis is now triply validated (strengthen/pre/post). H7 +18.3pp / H8 +23.3pp signal that deterministic Tool externalization carries strong, stable effects
- ❌ Reducer prompt strengthening — not recommended (the *position* itself is the risk, not prompt phrasing)
- ❌ Extractor + Reducer combination (Exp15 candidate) — not recommended (effects cancel)
- Other post-stage Role variants (Verifier, etc.) — on hold (post-stage = risky pattern likely generalizes)

Limitations: n=15 paired tasks (power-limited); 5 trials per (task, condition); orchestrator bug touched 2 reducer trials (direction-preserving but not zero-impact for data integrity); score_answer_v3 keyword matching cannot measure Reducer's *semantic* polish (the polished answers may be more readable but the scorer only sees keywords); Tool axis not exercised (math-04 ~zero on both); Tattoo schema's final_answer type inconsistency is the bug's root cause (separate plan candidate).

Detail: `docs/reference/exp13-reducer-role-analysis-2026-05-05.md`. Results: `experiments/exp13_reducer_role/results/exp13_reducer_role_20260504_191208.json` (baseline) + `exp13_reducer_abc.json` (reducer). Bug fix: commit `cf057b6`.

The hypothesis table above (H1~H11) remains unchanged (Closed-append-only policy). H12's entry is a new addition only.

## Exp14 — Search Tool note (2026-05-05)

A follow-up experiment (`exp14-search-tool`) tested **H13** — whether ABC agents that *actively* call a `search_chunks(query, top_k)` BM25 retrieval tool during cycles outperform a sufficient-context baseline (32K-context window with the full document in the prompt) on long-context tasks. This is the Architect-recommended Tool-axis exploration after the three Stage 5 Role-axis ablations (Exp11/12/13). Unlike the previous two negative results (Exp11 mixed-Judge, Exp13 Reducer), this is a *deterministic external tool* (BM25 lexical search) — extending the H7/H8 Tool-axis line that previously yielded +18.3pp / +23.3pp.

Conditions: baseline_abc_chunked (full document in prompt, ~26K tokens for Large-20K docs) vs abc_search_tool (question only + tool spec, agent decides when/how to call) × 10 longctx tasks (small/medium/large × needle/2-hop/3-hop) × 5 trials = 100 trials, plus 15 diagnostic trials with fix to capture tool_calls. Same Gemma 4 E4B model on all roles. Stage 2A/2B/2C + Exp11 c_caller / Exp12 extractor_pre_stage / Exp13 reducer_post_stage hooks all preserved. The orchestrator integrates `SEARCH_TOOL_SCHEMA` (registered in `experiments/tools/bm25_tool.py`) via OpenAI tool-calling protocol with `tool_choice="auto"` (agent decides whether to call). The existing `bm25_retrieve` from Exp09 is reused; stop-words filtering was added to the tokenizer. A `make_search_chunks_tool(corpus)` factory closes over the per-task chunked corpus so the agent sees only the tool, not the document directly.

Results (v3 scoring, 100 trials):
- baseline_abc_chunked: mean_acc=0.9500, err+null=0+0, avg cycles=7.0, avg dur=390s, cost=$0
- **abc_search_tool**: mean_acc=**0.7300**, err+null=7+7, avg cycles=7.1, avg dur=235s (−40%), cost=$0

Δ(search − baseline) = **−0.2200** — by far the largest negative effect in Stage 5 (compare Exp11 −0.081 NS, Exp13 −0.053 NS). Statistics (n=10 paired tasks): **Wilcoxon p=0.0312, paired t p=0.0115 — both SIGNIFICANT at α=0.05**. **Cohen's d = −1.000 (large effect)**. Bootstrap 95% CI Δ: **[−0.360, −0.100]** (does not include zero). This is **the first statistically significant verdict in Stage 5** (Exp10/11/12/13 were all NS at n=15).

Hop-type breakdown:
- needle (1-hop, n=15 trials): mean = **0.800** — diagnostic v2 confirmed 5/5 trials with exactly 1 call and 5/5 correct (BM25 top score 4.7–4.9, accurate query formation)
- 2-hop (n=20 trials): mean = **0.675** — catastrophic large-2hop-01 (base 1.0 → search 0.4)
- 3-hop (n=15 trials): mean = 0.733
- baseline 1.000 across all hop types (full-document prompt makes hop count irrelevant)

**H13 verdict (Architect)**: ⚠ **Inconclusive — effectively rejected, statistically significant negative direction at this scale**. The negative direction is robust (p<0.05, |d|=1.0, Bootstrap CI excludes 0); however, the result applies specifically to *agent-active BM25 retrieval against a 32K-context baseline on n=10 long-context tasks*, not to "Search Tool" as a general category. A weaker form of the hypothesis ("retrieval helps when context is the limit") is not addressed by this experiment because the baseline saturated.

**Mechanism — *insufficient retrieval iterations on multi-hop tasks***: The diagnostic run on `longctx-large-2hop-01` (Chen Wei → trained at Westbrook Institute → 347 patents) revealed a clear pattern across 5 trials with `total_tool_calls` per trial = [1, 2, 2, 3, 0] and accuracy = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]. The single-call trial (t0) recovered the hop-1 entity ("Westbrook Institute") then prematurely concluded "the document does not contain a specific [number]" instead of issuing a hop-2 query. The 2- and 3-call trials completed both hops and scored 1.0. The zero-call trial (t4) was a tool-neglect case (no_final_answer). For needle (single-hop) tasks the diagnostic showed 5/5 trials with exactly one well-formed call and 5/5 correct, indicating the negative direction is concentrated on multi-hop reasoning where the agent must decide to issue *additional* queries.

**Caveat — A-2 production run did not capture tool_calls**: The 50-trial A-2 main run was completed before the run.py whitelist fix (commit `a3b71af`) that adds `tool_calls_per_cycle` and `total_tool_calls` to the trial dict. The mechanism analysis therefore relies on the 15-trial diagnostic subset (medium-needle v2 + large-2hop), not on the production 50 trials. This is documented as a limitation; rerunning A-2 with the fix would consume another ~3-4 hours and is deferred since the direction and per-hop pattern are already established.

**Decisive contrast — Exp11 / Exp12 / Exp13 / Exp14**:

| | Exp11 Mixed (H10) | Exp12 Extractor (H11) | Exp13 Reducer (H12) | Exp14 Search (H13) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Externalization type | Role strengthening (stronger model) | Role separation/addition — pre-stage | Role separation/addition — post-stage | **Tool axis — agent-iterative retrieval** |
| Δ accuracy | −0.0811 | +0.0500 | −0.0533 | **−0.2200** |
| Cohen's d | −0.316 | +0.323 | −0.323 | **−1.000** |
| p-value | 0.293 (NS) | 0.198 (NS) | 0.180 (NS) | **0.012 (SIG)** ✅ |
| n_paired | 15 | 15 | 15 | 10 |
| Mechanism | chain disruption | input stabilization | abstraction loss (caveat) | **insufficient hop iterations** |
| Verdict | ⚠ Inconclusive (effectively rejected) | ⚠ Conditionally supported | ⚠ Inconclusive (effectively rejected) | **⚠ Inconclusive (effectively rejected, SIG)** |

**Stage 5 framework-level integrated principle**: Across the four ablations, the *sign* of an externalization effect depends jointly on (i) externalization type (Role strengthening vs separation/addition vs Tool), (ii) position in the workflow (pre vs post for Role addition), and (iii) iteration count (deterministic single-call computation tools vs agent-controlled multi-call retrieval). The naive prior — "more structure or more capability is better" — is rejected on multiple axes. We also identify a sub-distinction within the Tool axis itself: **deterministic computation tools** (calculator, linprog — H7/H8 +18~23pp) succeed, while **agent-iterative retrieval tools** (BM25 search — H13 −22pp) underperform under sufficient context. This is consistent with the §4.6 paper observation that role *position* matters more than role *addition*: in Exp14, the analogous claim is that *iteration discipline* (fixed vs agent-controlled, deterministic vs probabilistic) matters more than tool *availability*.

**Stage 6 implications**:
- 🎯 P0 — **Cross-model replication** (Llama 3.1 8B / Llama 3.3 70B / Qwen 2.5 7B Q4_K_M via Groq free tier + local) for Stage 5 hypotheses H10/H11/H12/H13. Infrastructure ready (`experiments/_external/groq_client.py`, commit `b389534`).
- 🎯 P0 — **LLM-as-judge auxiliary evaluation** (Groq GPT-OSS 120B) for H12 (Reducer, addressing the keyword-scorer artifact caveat from Exp13) and H13 (Search, addressing whether the search-arm answers are semantically equivalent to baseline answers despite the keyword-coverage drop).
- Iteration-count manipulation (analogous to the Exp08b "mandatory tool rules" pattern) — could fix H13 mechanism directly; deferred since the diagnostic data already establishes the cause.
- Other Tool sub-types (Graph traversal, Evidence resolution, strengthened Critic) — on hold pending the cross-model replication.

Limitations:
- n=10 paired tasks (longctx_taskset has 10 tasks; smaller than the 15-task main set used by Exp11/12/13). The large effect size (|d|=1.0) compensated for the smaller n to reach significance.
- 5 trials per (task, condition) — limited per-task sample.
- A-2 main 50-trial run lacks tool_call_log capture (fixed in commit `a3b71af` after the run completed); mechanism analysis uses 15 diagnostic trials.
- score_answer_v3 keyword matching — same caveat as H12, but milder here because longctx tasks have short-answer ground truths (numbers, names) that align reasonably with keyword detection.
- Tool axis tested only for *agent-active BM25 retrieval*; passive retrieve (Exp09 RAG arm) and other Tool sub-types are not covered by this single experiment.
- Sufficient-context baseline (32K window covers even Large 20K-word documents). The relative value of Search Tool against a *context-limited* baseline (e.g., 8K window) is not measured.
- `tool_choice="auto"` — the agent decides whether and how often to call. Mandatory tool rules (H8 pattern) might change the result.

## H14 — Cross-model generalization (Stage 6, partial, 2026-05-08)

### Summary

A follow-up cross-model replication tested **H14** — whether the *direction* of Stage 5's Position-Effect asymmetry (H11 Extractor pre-stage positive; H12 Reducer post-stage negative) generalizes across model families and sizes. Five models in total (Stage 5 baseline + 4 cross-model targets via Ollama Cloud Pro $20/month, 3-concurrent-model loading): Gemma 4 E4B (Stage 5), gemma3:4b, gemma3:12b (H11 done, H12 partial 28/75 baseline), rnj-1:8b, gpt-oss:20b. Same task set (15 main tasks) and trial count (5 per task × condition) as Stage 5.

### H11 (Extractor) — 6/7 positive, 1 outlier (Stage 6 v2)

| Model | family | size | Δ | Cohen's d | p (Wilcoxon) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gemma 4 E4B (Stage 5) | Gemma 4 | 4B effective | +0.0500 | +0.323 | 0.198 |
| gemma3:4b | Gemma 3 | 4B | **+0.0787** | +0.299 | 0.594 |
| gemma3:12b | Gemma 3 | 12B | +0.0022 | +0.009 | 0.888 |
| rnj-1:8b | non-Gemma | 8B | +0.0047 | +0.019 | 0.859 |
| gpt-oss:20b | OpenAI/reasoning | 20B | +0.0244 | +0.177 | 0.672 |
| **ministral-3:8b** | **Mistral 3** | **8B** | **−0.0433** ⚠ | **−0.292** | 0.311 |

Six of seven values are positive — the H11 direction (pre-stage Extractor helps) replicates across families and sizes, with **one Mistral 3 / 8B outlier** producing a small-magnitude negative effect (NS, p=0.311). The most plausible non-exclusive explanations for the outlier are: (a) baseline saturation — ministral-3:8b's H11 baseline 0.7178 is near the higher end of the panel, and Extractor may add noise rather than structure when the cycle-1 input is already well-organized; (b) Extractor prompt mismatch with Mistral 3's instruction-following pattern; (c) NS-at-n=15 — the result is statistically indistinguishable from zero. Direction match is *strong but not unanimous*. Magnitude is largest at weak baselines (4B group: +0.05~+0.08).

### H12 (Reducer) — Family-systematic pattern (Stage 6 v2)

| Model | family | size | Δ | Cohen's d | p (Wilcoxon) | direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gemma 4 E4B (Stage 5) | Gemma 4 | 4B | −0.0711 | −0.323 | 0.180 | non-Gemma negative |
| gemma3:4b | Gemma 3 | 4B | **+0.0562** | +0.331 | 0.423 | **Gemma 3 positive** |
| gemma3:12b (final) | Gemma 3 | 12B | **+0.0078** | +0.026 | 0.878 | **Gemma 3 positive** |
| rnj-1:8b | non-Gemma | 8B | **−0.0989** | **−0.617** | **0.036 ✅ SIG** | non-Gemma negative |
| gpt-oss:20b | non-Gemma | 20B | −0.0100 | −0.052 | 0.735 | non-Gemma negative |
| ministral-3:8b | non-Gemma | 8B | **−0.0707** | **−0.287** | 0.327 | non-Gemma negative |

H12 splits cleanly along family lines: **Gemma 3 family 2/2 positive** (gemma3:4b +0.056, gemma3:12b +0.008), **non-Gemma family 4/4 negative** (Stage 5 Gemma 4 E4B −0.071, rnj-1:8b −0.099 SIG, gpt-oss:20b −0.010, ministral-3:8b −0.071). This is a *family-systematic* pattern, not a single-outlier observation. The rnj-1:8b H12 result is the **first cross-model statistically significant verdict** in either direction (Wilcoxon p=0.036, |d|=0.617 medium-large) and supports the post-stage Reducer = abstraction-loss claim at the family level for non-Gemma models. The Gemma 3 family inversion (2/2 positive) is *direct family-level evidence* for paper §4.6.2 style-mismatch caveat (b): a learned output-style bias in Gemma 3 such that Reducer's compression accidentally regularizes the answer toward the scorer's expected vocabulary. The Gemma 4 E4B baseline (Stage 5) belongs to the non-Gemma group on this pattern, suggesting the bias is *Gemma-3-specific, not Gemma-family-wide*.

### H13 (Search Tool) — Specific-model identification, M2 4 sub-variants (Stage 6 v3)

Stage 6 v3 (2026-05-09) ran H13 on five small-and-mid dense models including a Gemma 4 same-family size-up control (gemma4:31b). **All five failed to operate the search-tool ABC chain**, with **four distinguishable M2 sub-variants** plus the Stage 5 (M1) under-iteration mode:

| Model | family | size | failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gemma 4 E4B (Stage 5) | Gemma 4 | 4B effective | **(M1) under-iteration on multi-hop** — tool-calling present, premature termination — Δ=−0.220 SIG |
| gemma3:4b | Gemma 3 | 4B | (M2-a) tool-calling absence — 0/50 calls |
| gemma3:12b | Gemma 3 | 12B | (M2-b) tool-calling not invoked — "Unknown" + max-cycle |
| ministral-3:3b | Mistral 3 | 3B | (M2-c) tool-calls + final_answer never produced (50/50) |
| ministral-3:8b | Mistral 3 | 8B | (M2-c) tool-calls + final_answer never produced (44/50) |
| **gemma4:31b** | **Gemma 4** | **31B** | **(M2-d) A-agent JSON schema mismatch** — tool-calls present, post-tool text response fails the expected assertions-JSON contract → assertions=0 across all cycles, never converged (45/50, 90%) |

**gemma4:31b paper-relevant note**: `baseline_abc_chunked` (no tool, document supplied directly in prompt) achieved 50/50 trials with mean_acc 0.95 — the model reads 26K-token documents fluently within the ABC chain. The H13 failure is *strictly* in the search-tool A-agent JSON-schema contract, not a capability deficit.

The H13 mechanism therefore splits into M1 (Gemma 4 E4B) and 4 M2 sub-variants across 5 other models. Within our cross-model panel, **(M1) iteration-effect is observable on *exactly one* model — Gemma 4 E4B (effective 4B)**. Same-family size-up (gemma4:31b) does *not* preserve M1; it joins the M2 group via (M2-d). The "minimum operational size" claim narrows from a *size threshold* to a **specific-model identification**: the 4-axis framework with our current A-agent JSON-schema contract operates only on Gemma 4 E4B in this panel. We treat this as a *measurement-tool fit* finding rather than a claim about intrinsic framework limits — alternative A-agent contracts may broaden M1 observability across models. Cross-family H13 replication on `rnj-1:8b` and `gpt-oss:20b` and contract-revision experiments are future work.

**Capability floor below 4B — ministral-3:3b** (3B dense, Mistral 3 family) failed both tool-free H11 (47/150 errors = 31.3%, exceeding the Stage 2A 30% reject gate) and H13 search-tool (50/50 errors = 100%). H13 baseline_chunked on the same model (no tool, document supplied directly) produced 0/50 errors with mean accuracy 0.840 — i.e., ministral-3:3b reads documents fine but cannot sustain the multi-cycle ABC chain. This sets a lower-bound data point for the framework's operating regime.

### H14 verdict v3 (Architect, 2026-05-09)

⚠ **Conditional accept — direction generalization strong, family-systematic pattern discovered, mechanism 5-mode split (M1 + 4 M2 sub-variants), single SIG, *measurement-tool fit caveat***:
- H11 direction: 6/7 positive (one outlier, ministral-3:8b — saturation hypothesis).
- H12 direction: family-systematic — Gemma 3 family 2/2 positive (direct family-level evidence for §4.6.2 style-mismatch caveat (b)), non-Gemma family 4/4 negative (rnj-1:8b SIG p=0.036).
- H13 mechanism: split into **(M1) under-iteration** (Gemma 4 E4B *only*) and **(M2) capability floor — 4 sub-variants** (M2-a tool-calling absence, M2-b not-invoked, M2-c final_answer non-production, M2-d A-agent JSON-schema mismatch — gemma4:31b new finding).
- **H13 (M1) iteration effect is observable on *exactly one* model — Gemma 4 E4B**. Same-family size-up (gemma4:31b) fails via M2-d; this is *not* a size threshold but a **specific-model identification**.
- gemma4:31b `baseline_abc_chunked` 95% acc / 0% errors confirms model capability is sufficient; the H13 failure is *strictly* in the A-agent JSON-schema contract — a *measurement-tool fit* between Gemma 4 E4B and our specific A-agent contract.
- ministral-3:3b 3B = capability floor breach (H11 31.3% reject, H13 100% reject) — lower-bound data point.

The Stage 5 findings — Position-Effect asymmetry (H11/H12) and Tool-axis iteration effect (H13) — generalize as follows after Stage 6 v3: H11/H12 directions hold across families and sizes (with one Mistral 3 outlier on H11 and a Gemma-3-specific style inversion on H12, both characterized rather than dismissed). The H13 (M1) iteration-effect framing is *Gemma 4 E4B-specific* under the current A-agent contract. We acknowledge this as a measurement-tool-fit narrowing of §1.3 contribution-1: future work revising the A-agent JSON-schema contract may broaden M1 observability and is left as a deferred item.

### Stage 5 ↔ Stage 6 integrated narrative

| Aspect | Stage 5 (single model) | Stage 6 (cross-model) |
|---|---|---|
| Position-effect asymmetry | proposed | **direction confirmed (5/5 H11, 3/4 H12)** |
| H12 keyword-scorer caveat | proposed | **gemma3:4b outlier = direct partial evidence** |
| H13 mechanism | under-iteration + premature termination | + Gemma-family tool-calling absence (family-level) |

### Limitations

- n=15 task × 5 trial — same constraint as Stage 5; cross-model replication trades depth for breadth.
- gemma3:12b H12 still partial (28/75 baseline) — to be refreshed in v2.
- LLM-as-judge auxiliary evaluation (P1-3) not yet executed — would help disambiguate the gemma3:4b outlier vs the keyword-scorer caveat.
- Cross-family scope limited to (rnj-1, gpt-oss) — Mistral / DeepSeek / Llama not yet covered.
- H13 cross-model attempted only on Gemma family; rnj-1 and gpt-oss tool-calling H13 reproduction is future work.
- Ollama Cloud Pro $20/month subscription required (paper reproducibility note).

## Change History

- 2026-04-26: `config.py:SAMPLING_PARAMS` centralization — `lmstudio_client.py` now explicitly sends sampling params. Pre-centralization LM Studio default may have differed from `temperature=0.1`/`max_tokens=4096`, so Exp10 results may show micro-variance vs Exp00~09. Treat the introduction date as a baseline boundary.
